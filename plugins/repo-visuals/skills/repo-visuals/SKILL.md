description: Create hero visuals — animated GIF or static PNG — for GitHub repositories. Runs a structured discovery conversation (scan repo → recommend format → propose creative scenarios → agree on a brief), then designs bespoke HTML, previews it in the browser, and exports.
---

# repo-visuals

Turn a repo (GitHub URL, local folder, or free-text brief) into a hero visual that a viewer sees at the top of the README and instantly understands *what this project does and why it's interesting*. The hero may be an **animated GIF** or a **static PNG** — the skill recommends one based on the repo's identity, the user picks.

The skill's quality comes from the **discovery dialog**, not from templates. Every hero is bespoke.

## Phases

1. **Discovery** — pick operating mode (Auto / Semi-auto / Manual, §1.1a), scan the repo, summarize findings, recommend a format (animated vs static), ask about vibe/audience/hero moment, propose 2–3 scenarios, converge on a brief. The mode controls *how many* of these the user answers vs. Claude decides silently — it does not skip any of the craft checks.
2. **Build** — write HTML/CSS/JS for the chosen scenario. For static, design one decisive frame; for animated, a loop. No storyboard step.
3. **Preview & iterate** — open the HTML in the user's default browser, iterate in text until the user says ship.
4. **Export** — animated → Puppeteer screencast + ffmpeg palette pipeline to GIF. Static → Puppeteer `page.screenshot` to PNG (with `deviceScaleFactor: 2` for retina crispness).
5. **Output** — place the hero in the target repo; optionally open a PR that embeds it in the README.

**Dev mode (author-only):** Phase 6 — Evaluate exists but **only runs in dev mode**. Dev mode is for the skill's author iterating on the skill itself; it collects scorecard data and writes run logs under `./evaluations/` in the user's current working directory. Enable it only when the user explicitly says "dev mode" (or sets `REPO_VISUALS_DEV=1`). In every normal run — including Manual, Semi-auto, and Auto — the skill ends after Phase 5. Do not mention Phase 6 to end users.

---

## Phase 1 — Discovery

Discovery runs **before any HTML is written**. Its job: go from a vague ask ("make a hero GIF for my repo") to a specific, committed creative brief.

### 1.1 Activation

Enter discovery mode whenever the user invokes the skill, **unless** they explicitly say "skip discovery, I have the brief ready."

### 1.1a Operating mode (ask first, once per run)

Before anything else — before the scan summary, before any direction questions — ask the user which operating mode they want for this run. Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool so the choice is structured and visible, not buried in free text. Offer three modes; describe each in concrete terms (what gets asked, what gets decided silently) and include pros/cons so the user can pick with open eyes. Default recommendation: **Semi-auto**.

> Note: this "operating mode" is a skill-level concept about how many questions the skill asks. It is distinct from the Claude Code harness's own auto-mode; the two do not replace each other.

Question shape:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    header: "Run mode",
    question: "How involved do you want to be in this run? This affects how many decisions I ask you to make before we ship an artifact.",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      {
        label: "Semi-auto (Recommended)",
        description: "I decide vibe, audience, scenario, dimensions, copy. You decide: output format (GIF/PNG/HTML) and one preview-and-iterate review before export. ~2 decisions. Pros: fast, keeps production-grade gate, keeps your taste in the loop on the things that matter most. Cons: you miss input on smaller creative calls."
      },
      {
        label: "Manual",
        description: "I ask you at every decision point — scenario pick, vibe confirmation, brief approval, preview iteration rounds, export ship-intent. I still make suggestions and recommendations at each step. Pros: max control, highest ceiling on quality. Cons: slow — 8–12 back-and-forths before an artifact."
      },
      {
        label: "Auto",
        description: "I make every decision and go straight to the exported artifact (GIF or PNG, my call). Pros: hands-off, 0 decisions, fastest path to a shippable draft. Cons: lower quality ceiling, more risk of missing your taste or the repo's real scope; expect to redirect after seeing the result."
      }
    ]
  }]
})
```

Rules that apply to **every** mode regardless of choice (craft non-negotiables):

- **§1.3 inventory count is always collected.** Auto/semi don't skip it.
- **§4.0 scope-match rule is always enforced.** If the hero says "all" or shows a grid, on-screen reality must match the real inventory — regardless of mode.
- **Any mode can be upgraded mid-run.** If Auto drifts, user can say "stop, switch to semi" and we resume from the nearest decision point. Do not silently re-ask everything; pick up at the next unanswered question.

After the user picks a mode, commit it to memory for the run (e.g. "Mode: Semi-auto") and reference it when deciding whether to ask or decide silently at each subsequent step. In Auto and Semi-auto, make decisions with a brief one-line note ("going with the Product-UI marketing archetype per §1.4c — amplication-shape repo") so the user can redirect if they disagree.

### 1.2 Input triage

User may provide:

- **GitHub URL** → clone shallow, plus use `gh repo view` for stars/topics/languages/releases.
- **Local path** → scan the tree directly.
- **Free-text brief only** → proceed to direction questions immediately.
- **Nothing** → ask first for one of the above.

### 1.3 Scan checklist (collect a lot)

Gather as much as possible before asking the user anything. Goal: Claude should already have an opinion about what this repo is before the vibe conversation starts.

- README (full text) — extract tagline from first paragraph.
- Manifest(s): `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `*.csproj`, etc. — description, keywords, dependencies, entry points.
- File tree (depth 3) + top 10 files by size.
- Language breakdown (LOC per language).
- Existing visuals in repo: `assets/`, `docs/`, `.github/`, any `*.png` / `*.gif` / `*.svg` near the root.
- `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md` — maturity signal.
- Recent git log (last 10 commits) — what's active.
- If GitHub: stars, topics, releases, open issues count.
- If `ast-graph` is available locally and the repo has supported languages: run `scan` + `hotspots` + `symbol` on top-level exports for structural inventory.
- **Count the real inventory** — if the repo exposes a collection (tools, commands, pages, themes, plugins, routes), count them from source (route files, `src/tools/*`, CLI command registrations, etc.). Do not estimate from the README. This number is used later: any hero that says "all", "every", "the whole", or shows a grid meant to represent scope must match this count — or explicitly frame itself as a sample ("10 of 30 shown", scroll affordance, "30+"). An undercount reads as a broken promise.

Summarize findings back to the user in ~6–10 bullets so they can correct misreadings early. Include the inventory count when one exists.

### 1.4 Direction questions (after the scan summary)

Ask these as a structured batch, with suggested defaults based on what the scan found so the user can just accept or redirect:

1. **Where will this hero live?** — README top / project website / social posts (Twitter, LinkedIn) / conference slide / internal demo / elsewhere. *This drives dimensions and loop length.*
2. **Output format?** — **animated GIF** / **static image (PNG)** / **HTML only (no export)**. Not every repo wants motion; some strong identities read better as one sharp frame. Scan the repo first and offer a recommendation (see §1.4c), then let the user override. Default: whichever §1.4c recommends. *(MP4/WebM and square social cards are listed in the future-formats appendix.)*
3. **Audience** — working devs / eng leaders / newcomers / prospective contributors / all
4. **Vibe** — minimal, playful, technical, cinematic, retro-terminal, brutalist, polished-SaaS
5. **Energy** — calm & meditative / steady / frenetic & showy
6. **Hero moment** — the single thing a viewer should take away
7. **Hard constraints** — brand colors, existing fonts, imagery to include/avoid, duration cap

### 1.4a Probing when the user doesn't know

Many users will answer "I don't know" to vibe / hero moment / audience. That's normal. Don't force them to guess — extract intent sideways:

- **"Show me a repo whose hero you liked"** — reverse-engineer what they respond to.
- **"What do you wish someone understood about this project in 10 seconds?"** — surfaces the hero moment without asking for it directly.
- **"Who's the person whose opinion about this repo matters most to you?"** — surfaces the audience.
- **"Is this repo a calm/serious tool or a fun/exciting one?"** — a binary that usually works for vibe.

If they still can't articulate, offer Claude's best guess based on the scan and ask them to confirm or push back. Be willing to **commit first, confirm second** — a concrete wrong guess triggers better reactions than another open-ended question.

### 1.4c Format recommendation (animated vs static)

Before asking Q2, form an opinion from the scan. **First consult `craft/reference-gallery.md`** — try to place the target repo in one of the catalogued archetypes (Terminal-demo GIF / Product-UI marketing / Brand-first logo / Banner/promo graphic / Diagram-as-hero) and cite the match by name when recommending. If no clean match, fall back to the heuristics below.

The repo's identity tells you which format fits:

**Lean static (PNG) when:**
- The repo's pitch is a **surface**, not a process — a landing page, a typography choice, an API shape, a single striking screenshot.
- Existing visuals in `assets/` / `docs/` are already static and strong.
- The vibe is brutalist, editorial, documentation-first, or "the screenshot is the product" (design systems, component libs shown in a grid, CLI themes whose appeal is one frame).
- Audience skews toward skim-then-click (social posts shared as preview cards, directory listings).
- README opens with one crisp hero sentence and a screenshot — mirror that, don't animate it.

**Lean animated (GIF) when:**
- There's a **before→after transformation**, a step sequence, or a multi-stage pipeline — the motion *is* the pitch.
- The repo is a tool with visible runtime behavior (CLI output, live reload, computation unfolding).
- The hero moment is "watch this happen," not "see this exists."
- The scan surfaces multiple distinct capabilities worth walking through (then: animated; or: static grid).

**Lean HTML-only when:**
- The user will embed on a site they control and wants the live animation.
- The user explicitly wants to iterate further with their own tools.

Present the recommendation forcefully: *"Based on the scan, I'd go **static** — this repo's identity is [X], and motion would add noise not signal. Want me to proceed with static, or would you rather animated?"* Then honor whatever they pick.

### 1.5 Scenario proposal

Offer **2–3 concrete scenarios** (two if the viable directions are closely related, three if they diverge meaningfully), each with:

- **Concept** — one line
- **Scene beats** — 3–5 bullets describing what happens second-by-second
- **Vibe anchor** — a visual reference ("think Linear changelog", "think `htop`")
- **Why it suits this repo** — one paragraph grounding it in the scan findings
- **Risk** — one line on what could make this one weaker

Then **Claude's recommendation**: pick one and argue for it forcefully in 1–2 sentences. Frame it as something the user can still redirect.

### 1.6 Convergence signal — "enough info"

Move to the build phase when all six are settled:

- [ ] Chosen scenario (one of the 2–3 proposed, possibly with edits)
- [ ] Vibe locked
- [ ] Hero moment named in one sentence
- [ ] Audience named
- [ ] Hard constraints captured (or confirmed "none")
- [ ] Output format chosen (animated GIF / static PNG / HTML only)
- [ ] Placement agreed (README / website / social / slide / other)
- [ ] Duration chosen — animated only (typical: 15–25s loop; default 20s); skip for static
- [ ] Dimensions chosen (see §1.7 — NOT a fixed default; pick per repo and placement)
- [ ] Real inventory count captured from §1.3 scan (if the repo has a countable collection)
- [ ] Operating mode recorded from §1.1a (Auto / Semi-auto / Manual)

Write the brief back to the user in a compact block. Wait for **"go"** before writing any HTML — *unless* the mode is **Auto**, in which case proceed directly to Phase 2 with a brief summary line and no wait. In **Semi-auto**, show the brief but proceed after a brief pause unless the user interjects. In **Manual**, wait explicitly for "go".

### 1.7 Dimension selection

Dimensions are **not fixed**. Choose per repo based on what the hero needs to show:

| Aspect | Typical use | When to choose |
|---|---|---|
| 1200×675 (16:9) | Rich product demo, multi-scene storytelling, terminal + UI + graph | CLI tools with visual output, apps, dashboards, complex projects |
| 1200×450 (~8:3) | Compact demo with a primary focus area | Most libraries with one standout feature |
| 1200×400 (3:1) | Banner-style, tagline + single animated flourish | Simple libraries, frameworks, minimalist vibe |
| 1200×300 (4:1) | Slim marquee, logo + one beat | Tiny utilities, one-liners, brand-first projects |
| 1200×200 (6:1) | Ultra-slim status-line feel | CLI themes, shell utilities, prompts |
| 800×800 (1:1) | Social-card crossover | When the hero will also post to Twitter / LinkedIn |

Recommend one based on the scan (forcefully, per the recommendation style), then let the user override.

---

## Phase 2 — Build

Once the brief is locked and the user says "go", write the HTML in **one file** (`index.html` in a working directory for this repo's hero).

### 2.1 Working directory

Default layout — always nest per-repo under a subdirectory named after the target repo (e.g. `last30days-skill`, `my-cli`):

```
<current-dir>/repo-visuals-work/<repo-name>/
  index.html        # the hero animation source
  assets/           # any images/SVGs the scenario needs
```

Use `repo-visuals-work/<repo-name>/` so the scratch files stay obviously separate from the target repo **and** runs for different repos don't clobber each other. Never write directly into `repo-visuals-work/` — always into the repo-named subfolder. If no obvious repo name, use a short slug derived from the brief.

### 2.2 Re-read the README before writing

Open the target repo's README once more right before writing HTML. Mirror its actual phrasing, headings, and technical terms in the animation's on-screen text. The hero should feel like it was written *by* the repo author, not *for* them.

### 2.2a Consult the craft library

Before writing any scene copy or layout, read:

- `craft/headlines.md` — headline patterns (imperative-plus-invariant, narrative arc), voice rules, anti-patterns.
- `craft/templates/*.html` — full working heroes from past runs. Read end-to-end to see how a complete scene system is composed (stage + browser chrome + tool-body + rotating hero text + progress indicator + timeline scheduler). Don't copy verbatim — steal patterns.

Every scene needs a headline. A demo without copy delivers no meaning.

### 2.3 Structure of `index.html`

Single self-contained file. No build step. Sections:

1. **Stage** — a fixed container sized to the chosen dimensions (§1.7). Everything absolutely positioned inside. Outside the stage: a subtle page background so the capture crop is unambiguous.
2. **Fonts & tokens** — import fonts at the top (Google Fonts `@import`), define CSS custom properties for the palette (`--bg`, `--accent`, `--text`, `--muted`, etc.) derived from the vibe/constraints.
3. **Scene DOM** — the HTML elements that each scene uses. Build all of them upfront; scenes show/hide via classes.
4. **Timeline object** — a JS `TIMELINE` with named keys (e.g. `scene2Start: 3500`) so pacing is tweakable in one spot. Include `loopPauseAt` so the animation has a clean loop boundary.
5. **Timer helpers** — `schedule(t, fn)` wrapping `setTimeout` into an `animTimers` array, plus a `runLoop()` that clears and restarts. This is what the export pipeline calls to reset to t=0 deterministically.
6. **Scenes** — each scene is a plain function that flips classes / starts tweens. Keep CSS transitions for simple motion; use small rAF-driven tweens for counters or typing effects.

### 2.4 Rules of thumb

- **Durations**: match the chosen loop length (default 20s). Each scene ~3–6s, never so fast the viewer can't read it. Shorter dimensions (banner / slim) naturally want shorter loops — 10–15s.
- **Motion**: use `transform` and `opacity` only — never `top/left/width/height` (janky, expensive).
- **Type**: scale the minimum body size to stage height — ~2.5% of stage height, bumped up for GIF legibility. At 675h that's ~17px; at 300h that's ~14px minimum. Never below 13px.
- **Palette**: pick 4–6 colors. More kills GIF compression *and* looks busy.
- **Loop seam**: the last frame should visually match the first (or transition back smoothly). `runLoop()` is the hard reset if needed.
- **Determinism**: no `Math.random()` without a seed, no `Date.now()`-based logic. Everything must replay identically each capture.
- **Avoid the NY Times / editorial-newspaper theme**: no serif-headline + rule-lines + dateline + column-grid pastiche. It's become a default AI-design shortcut and reads as generic. Pick a visual language that actually suits the repo's domain (terminal, data-viz, spatial, playful, brutalist, neon, etc.) — not a broadsheet aesthetic unless the repo is explicitly about journalism or publishing.

### 2.5 When to stop writing and preview

First preview as soon as:

- All scenes are implemented (even if polish is rough)
- Timing hits the full duration target
- No console errors

Don't polish before first preview. User's reaction on overall shape is more valuable than Claude's local polish loop.

---

## Phase 3 — Preview & iterate

Keep this phase conversational. The goal is to converge on a version the user loves before spending time on export.

### 3.1 Open in browser

After writing `index.html`, **give the user the command** to open it themselves (their browser, their timing):

- **Windows**: `start repo-visuals-work/<repo-name>/index.html`
- **macOS**: `open repo-visuals-work/<repo-name>/index.html`
- **Linux**: `xdg-open repo-visuals-work/<repo-name>/index.html`

Tell them to watch **one full loop** (the animation restarts automatically via `runLoop()`).

### 3.2 What to ask after first preview

Keep first-preview questions focused on **shape**, not polish:

- Does the *hero moment* land?
- Does the overall pace feel right (too fast? too slow?)
- Does any scene feel confusing or unnecessary?
- Does the loop seam look clean?

Don't ask about colors/fonts/spacing on the first round. Polish comes after shape is right.

### 3.3 Iteration rhythm

- Each round: Claude edits, user refreshes, one sentence of reaction.
- After shape converges, switch to polish rounds: type hierarchy, color calibration, micro-timing, loop seam.
- If user gives vague feedback ("feels off"), ask **one pointed question** to narrow it — don't guess.
- **Style stuck? Invoke `frontend-design`.** If the user has gone back-and-forth on *style* (palette, type, overall aesthetic, visual language) for **3+ rounds** without converging — or says something like "still not it" / "try a totally different direction" — stop tweaking in place. Invoke the `frontend-design` skill via the `Skill` tool to get a fresh, high-quality design pass. Pass it the brief, the repo scan summary, the current `index.html`, and a plain-language description of what's not working. Use its output as the new starting point, then return to this iteration loop. Don't invoke it for pacing, timing, or animation-logic feedback — only when the blocker is *visual design quality*.

### 3.4 Mid-build GIF sanity check *(only if GIF is a target output)*

GIF quantization causes specific failures that HTML preview hides: small text blurs, near-identical hues posterize, fine gradients band. If GIF was selected in §1.4, run the export pipeline **once** at ~70% polish so these surface before the final polish rounds. Check:

- Is small text still legible?
- Do any colors posterize badly?
- Does the animation feel the same speed as the HTML?

If problems appear, tune the HTML (bigger type, fewer palette neighbors, simpler gradients) and keep iterating on the preview.

**Skip this section entirely if the output is not a GIF** (MP4/WebM preserve HTML fidelity; static outputs are sampled directly).

### 3.5 Stop signal

Stop iterating when the user says "ship it" (or equivalent). Don't invite more rounds — excess polish is real cost. If Claude thinks there's still a clear improvement available, mention it *once* and let the user decide.

### 3.6 Deliver all the intent, even unstated

The user may not fully know what they want. Keep watching for mismatches between the scan/brief and the HTML behavior:

- Did the README say "fast"? The hero should feel quick, not luxurious.
- Is the audience newcomers? Don't assume they know jargon — the hero's text should echo README phrasing.
- Did the brief say "calm"? Check for accidental frenetic motion (fast cuts, snappy eases).

When you spot a mismatch, flag it proactively ("the README leans 'fast' but the current pacing is slower — intentional, or should we tighten?"). Deliver intent, not just instructions.

---

## Phase 4 — Export

### 4.0 Entry gate — do not skip

Before you export anything, confirm — the exact gate depends on operating mode (§1.1a):

| Gate item | Manual | Semi-auto | Auto |
|---|---|---|---|
| User has **seen the artifact running** (open in browser or rendered screenshot) | required | required | skipped |
| At least **one iteration round** after first look | required | required | skipped |
| **Scope match** — hero claims (*"all"*, *"every"*, grid/list representing the repo) match real inventory from §1.3, or explicitly framed as sample ("10 of 30", "30+", scroll affordance) | **required** | **required** | **required** |
| User has explicitly said ship / go / export | required | required (after 1 preview) | not required |

The scope-match rule is **non-negotiable in every mode** — it's a craft check, not a human-involvement question. The human-in-the-loop items are what modes toggle.

Export is the **last** step, not a midpoint. A capture→encode→evaluate cycle feels productive but burns the user's patience on a draft that wasn't ready. When in doubt between "export this pass" and "one more iteration", prefer the iteration — except in Auto mode, where the point is to deliver a first draft fast and let the user redirect.

### 4.1 Prerequisites (ask before installing)

Check presence, list missing, ask the user before installing:

- **Node.js + `puppeteer`** — via `node --version` and looking for `node_modules/puppeteer`. If missing: `npm install puppeteer` (~170MB Chromium download).
- **`ffmpeg`** — via `ffmpeg -version`. If missing:
  1. Prefer system package manager (`choco install ffmpeg`, `brew install ffmpeg`, `apt install ffmpeg`) — needs admin.
  2. On Windows without admin, download **portable** ffmpeg from `https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases/latest` and extract `ffmpeg.exe` into the skill's `bin/` dir. Do NOT add to PATH; call by absolute path.

Never install silently. Show the plan, ask, then act.

### 4.2 Capture script (reused across repos)

Ship at `<skill-dir>/scripts/capture.js`. Accepts CLI args:

```
node capture.js --html <path-to-index.html> --out <frames-dir> --duration 20700 --width 1200 --height 675
```

### 4.3 Branch on chosen format

Based on the format decided in Phase 1.4c:

- **Animated GIF** → continue with §4.3 (GIF pipeline).
- **Static PNG** → skip to §4.3s (static pipeline).
- **HTML only** → skip Phase 4 entirely; the hand-off is `repo-visuals-work/<repo-name>/index.html`.

### 4.3g GIF pipeline (the proven recipe)

Use as-is unless there's a specific reason to deviate.

**Capture:**

- Launch Puppeteer (`headless: 'new'`).
- `setViewport({ width, height, deviceScaleFactor: 1 })`.
- `page.goto(file://...)` with `waitUntil: 'networkidle0'`.
- `await page.evaluateHandle('document.fonts.ready')`.
- Small real-time settle (300ms).
- `await page.evaluate(() => window.runLoop())` to reset the animation to t=0.
- Create a CDP session: `page.target().createCDPSession()`.
- Subscribe to `Page.screencastFrame` — save each frame as PNG, record `metadata.timestamp` (seconds).
- `client.send('Page.startScreencast', { format: 'png', everyNthFrame: 1 })`.
- Wait `duration + 200ms`, then `Page.stopScreencast` and close browser.
- Write an ffmpeg **concat manifest** with per-frame durations from timestamp deltas — preserves the real paint cadence.

**Why screencast, not screenshot-loop or virtual-time:** real screencast records exactly what the compositor paints, including CSS transitions. Screenshot loops drift under load; virtual-time (`Emulation.setVirtualTimePolicy`) freezes the compositor and captures stale frames.

**Encode (two-pass palette):**

```bash
# Pass 1: palette tuned for motion
ffmpeg -y -f concat -safe 0 -i frames.txt \
  -vf "fps=30,palettegen=stats_mode=diff:max_colors=256" \
  palette.png

# Pass 2: apply palette with sharp-text dither
ffmpeg -y -f concat -safe 0 -i frames.txt -i palette.png \
  -lavfi "fps=30 [x]; [x][1:v] paletteuse=dither=bayer:bayer_scale=5:diff_mode=rectangle" \
  -loop 0 hero.gif
```

- `stats_mode=diff` — palette focuses on moving regions; static UI chrome doesn't dominate.
- `bayer:bayer_scale=5` — sharper than `sierra2_4a` for UI text. Try `dither=none` if text is still blurry and gradients are minimal.
- Do **not** re-scale in the filter graph if frames are already the target size.

**Size budget:**

- **Target: ≤ 10 MB** — default cap. Renders cleanly on GitHub, mobile / slow connections don't suffer.
- **Hard max: 15 MB** — only if the content genuinely requires it *and* the user has confirmed they accept the bigger file. Never exceed silently.
- Reduction ladder when over 10 MB: drop to `fps=20` → drop to `fps=15` → `max_colors=192` → `max_colors=128` → shorten loop. Apply in order; stop as soon as under budget.

### 4.3s Static PNG pipeline

For the static format, skip ffmpeg entirely — a single crisp screenshot is enough.

**Capture via Puppeteer:**

- Launch Puppeteer (`headless: 'new'`).
- `setViewport({ width, height, deviceScaleFactor: 2 })` — retina-crisp for README rendering at native size.
- `page.goto(file://...)` with `waitUntil: 'networkidle0'`.
- `await page.evaluateHandle('document.fonts.ready')`.
- Settle 500ms so any entrance transition finishes.
- `await page.screenshot({ path: 'hero.png', type: 'png', omitBackground: false })`.

If the HTML has an animation that evolves over time, either:
- Design the static HTML to render its final/decisive frame at t=0 (preferred), or
- Before the screenshot: `await page.evaluate(() => window.seekTo(<seconds>))` if the source HTML exposes such a hook.

**Optional compression:** run `pngquant --quality=80-95 hero.png --output hero.png --force` if the PNG is over ~500 KB. Static heroes rarely need it.

**Size budget:**

- Target: ≤ 500 KB for a 1200-wide retina PNG. If over 1 MB, compress.

**Ship script:** `node scripts/screenshot.js --html <path> --out hero.png --width 1200 --height 675` (thin wrapper around the steps above — see `scripts/screenshot.js`).

### 4.4 Output file name

- Animated → `repo-visuals-work/<repo-name>/hero.gif`
- Static   → `repo-visuals-work/<repo-name>/hero.png`

Keep in the scratch dir until Phase 5 (Output) moves it.

---

### Appendix — future formats

Future formats Claude may extend this skill with — not part of the current export pipeline:

- **MP4 / WebM loop** — `libx264 -crf 18` or `libvpx-vp9 -crf 32`. Higher fidelity, smaller files. Note: GitHub renders `.mp4` uploaded via issue/PR drag-and-drop but not `.mp4` checked into the repo and linked in markdown.
- **Square social card (800×800 or 1200×1200)** — variant of static PNG, often reframed rather than cropped, with headline overlay tuned for LinkedIn / Twitter preview rendering.
- **9-frame contact sheet** — helper for picking the decisive moment of a long animation before static export.

---

## Phase 5 — Output

Move `hero.gif` from the scratch dir into the target repo, update the README, and optionally open a PR.

### 5.1 Placement in the target repo

Read the target repo to infer convention, then ask. Priority order when inferring:

1. Existing `assets/` or `images/` → follow it.
2. Existing `docs/` with images → place at `docs/hero.gif` (or `docs/<repo-name>-hero.gif` if multiple visuals).
3. Existing `.github/` with images → `.github/hero.gif`.
4. No visible convention → default to `assets/hero.gif` and create the dir.

File name: default `hero.gif`. If the repo already has a `hero.gif` or keeps multiple visuals, prefer `<repo-name>-hero.gif` or `<repo-name>-demo.gif`.

### 5.2 README embed

Read the README first. Ask:

- **Top of README** (most common) → insert `![alt](path)` right after the H1 title and tagline.
- **Replace an existing image** → identify it, confirm with user.
- **Specific section** → user names where.

Alt text default: `<repo-name> demo` (user can override).

### 5.3 Commit

Branch name default: `docs/add-hero-gif`. Override if the repo has a branch-name convention (check recent PRs or `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

Commit message default: `docs: add animated hero gif to README`. Follow existing commit style (conventional commits, imperative, etc.).

**Co-author footer: default OFF.** Only add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` footer if the user explicitly opts in for this repo.

### 5.4 Push & PR

Detect auth and repo ownership:

- **User owns the repo** → push branch to `origin`, open PR via `gh pr create` against the default branch.
- **User does NOT own the repo** → `gh repo fork --clone=false`, add the fork as a remote, push the branch there, then `gh pr create --repo <upstream> --head <user>:<branch>`.
- **Not authed as the account the user wants to use** → stop and ask them to `gh auth login` as the right account. Never guess.

Commit identity: if the user specifies a different git account for this repo, set `user.name` / `user.email` on the local repo config only, not globally. Use `<login>@users.noreply.github.com` if email is unknown.

### 5.5 Hand-off

After the PR opens, report:

- PR URL
- Final GIF size
- Placement path in the repo
- What was added/changed in the README (one-line diff summary)

Stop there.

### 5.6 Opt-out: local-only

If the user doesn't want a PR, leave `hero.gif` at `repo-visuals-work/<repo-name>/hero.gif` and print the path. Don't modify the target repo.

## Phase 6 — Evaluate *(dev mode only — skip in normal runs)*

**Gate:** run this phase only when dev mode is active (user said "dev mode" this run, or `REPO_VISUALS_DEV=1`). In every other run — Manual, Semi-auto, Auto — stop after Phase 5. Do not ask user-rating questions, do not write run logs, do not mention this phase.

Score the **final artifact**, not the process. In dev mode, always runs at the end.

### 6.1 Criteria (four rater types)

Each criterion is rated by exactly one of: **User**, **Claude** (subjective, chat-blind), **Code** (deterministic script), or **AI** (Claude re-reads the final GIF/HTML with vision, blind to prior chat).

**User-rated (3) — viewer-side truth.**

| Criterion | What it measures | Signal for low score |
|---|---|---|
| **Hero moment delivery** | Does a cold viewer "get it" in ~10 seconds — both *what the repo is* and *why they'd reach for it*? | After one loop, viewer still can't state the repo's purpose or motivation |
| **Visual impact** | Does the artifact make the viewer *want* to try the repo? | Looks fine but feels generic; no pull |
| **Ship-worthiness** | Gut check: would the user paste this into the repo's README today, as-is? | User hesitates, wants "one more pass" |

**Claude-rated (1) — repo-fit judgment.**

| Criterion | What it measures | Signal for low score |
|---|---|---|
| **Repo fidelity** | Do on-screen text, terminology, and vibe feel like this specific repo's own voice? | Headlines read like generic marketing; terminology drifts from README |

**Code-evaluated — `scripts/evaluate.js` runs automatically after export. Rows depend on format.**

| Criterion | Applies to | Pass rule | Fail signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **File size** | GIF + PNG | GIF: ≤ 10 MB target / ≤ 15 MB cap. PNG: ≤ 500 KB target / ≤ 1 MB cap. | Over target → 3; over cap → 1 |
| **Dimensions** | GIF + PNG | Matches spec (e.g. 1200×675). PNG at 2× device pixel scale is also acceptable. | Wrong size → 1 |
| **Loop duration** | GIF only | 15–25 s (hero default) | Outside band → 2 |
| **Loop seam** | GIF only | First-frame vs last-frame pixel diff under ~2% | Visible jump on loop → 2 |
| **Palette size** | GIF only | Palette ≤ 256, no visible banding on solid regions | Banding detected → 2 |

**AI-evaluated (4) — Claude re-opens the exported artifact with vision, blind to prior chat. Prompt in §6.3.**

| Criterion | What it measures | Signal for low score |
|---|---|---|
| **Legibility** | Every headline readable at native render size, no sub-pixel smear | Any headline unreadable → 2 |
| **Scene clarity** | Each scene conveys one idea in its airtime | Two scenes blur together or one feels like filler → 3 |
| **Voice match** | Headlines match tone and terminology of the repo's README | Drift from repo's own language → 2 |
| **Intent delivery** | After one loop, can a cold viewer state *why* to reach for this repo? | Demos *what* without delivering *why* → 3 |

### 6.2 Scale (1–5, labeled)

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Poor | Falls apart on the criterion |
| 2 | Weak | Noticeably misses |
| 3 | OK | Gets there, nothing more |
| 4 | Strong | Clearly delivers |
| 5 | Excellent | Best-in-class for this repo |

Use the labels, not bare numbers. A "3" alone is noise; "3 / OK" is meaningful.

### 6.3 Hand-off scorecard

Assemble in four steps:

1. **Run code eval** — `node scripts/evaluate.js <path-to-hero.gif-or-png>` → emits a JSON scorecard.
2. **Run AI eval** — extract 4–6 keyframes from the GIF first (`ffmpeg -ss <t> -i hero.gif -update 1 -frames:v 1 frame.png` at evenly spaced times), then re-read each frame with vision, blind to prior chat. Use this fixed prompt — **anchored, evidence-required, and fed the repo's real inventory** so factual drift is catchable:

   > You are evaluating a hero GIF for the repo `<owner/repo>`.
   >
   > **Repo ground truth (from §1.3 scan):**
   > - README excerpt (first 40 lines): `<excerpt>`
   > - Real inventory count: `<N>` (e.g. "30 tools", "12 commands", "N/A"). Specific names: `<list if applicable>`.
   > - Stated hero moment (from §1.6 brief): `<one sentence>`
   >
   > **Rating protocol — read carefully:**
   > - **Default every score to 3 / OK.** A 3 means "gets there, nothing more." Only move up with specific visual evidence from the frames; only move down with specific visual evidence of a problem.
   > - **4 / Strong requires one concrete observation** from the frames that the criterion is clearly delivered (cite it in the note).
   > - **5 / Excellent requires two concrete observations AND that you cannot name a realistic improvement.** If you can name one, cap at 4.
   > - Do not grade on effort, intent, or potential. Grade only what is visible in the frames.
   > - Compare on-screen claims against the repo ground truth. If the hero says *"all"* / *"every"* / shows a grid of N items but the repo has more, **cap Intent delivery at 2 / Weak** and note the undercount. An unverified claim is weaker than a verified one.
   >
   > **Rate each of Legibility, Scene clarity, Voice match, Intent delivery (1–5 Poor/Weak/OK/Strong/Excellent)** with a one-sentence justification citing specific frame evidence. Do not reference any prior conversation — judge only what you see in the frames and read in the ground truth above.
   >
   > **At the end, for any score ≥ 4, answer: "what specific change would push this to 5?" If you have an answer, lower the score by one.**

3. **Fill Claude's repo-fidelity row** with a one-sentence justification.
4. **Ask the user** for the 3 User rows via the `AskUserQuestion` tool — **in Manual and Semi-auto only**. In **Auto** mode, skip the User rows entirely; compute the overall average from Code + AI + Claude rows alone and flag in the run file that User ratings were not collected (so the evaluations index can weight it correctly).

   Use four questions in one call: Hero moment delivery, Visual impact, Ship-worthiness, and a fourth free-text-via-Other for the one-line feedback. Structure each rating question with four labeled options matching the scale (omit 5 to fit the 4-option max; users can pick "Other" to enter 5/Excellent or a custom score). Example shape:

   ```
   AskUserQuestion({
     questions: [
       {
         header: "Hero moment",
         question: "Hero moment delivery — after one loop, would a cold viewer get *what* this repo is *and why* they'd reach for it?",
         options: [
           { label: "2 / Weak", description: "Noticeably misses" },
           { label: "3 / OK", description: "Gets there, nothing more" },
           { label: "4 / Strong", description: "Clearly delivers" },
           { label: "1 / Poor", description: "Falls apart" }
         ],
         multiSelect: false
       },
       { header: "Visual impact", question: "Visual impact — does it make you want to try the repo?", options: [/* same 4 */], multiSelect: false },
       { header: "Ship-worthiness", question: "Ship-worthiness — would you paste this into the README today, as-is?", options: [/* same 4 */], multiSelect: false },
       {
         header: "Feedback",
         question: "One line of free-text feedback — the single most useful signal for next time.",
         options: [
           { label: "Nothing to add", description: "Skip this round" },
           { label: "Add a comment", description: "Pick 'Other' to type your line" }
         ],
         multiSelect: false
       }
     ]
   })
   ```

   The "Other" escape hatch covers 5 / Excellent and any other custom response. Capture the returned labels + any `annotations.notes` or "Other" text into the scorecard.

Display the completed table, grouped by rater, then compute an overall simple average. Keep the full table in the run file.

### 6.4 Evaluation log (two-tier)

Write all evaluation files under `./evaluations/` in the **user's current working directory** — NOT the plugin cache, which is wiped on `/plugin update`. Create the directory if it doesn't exist on first dev-mode run.

**Tier 1 — curated aggregate (committed):** `./evaluations/index.md`
- Rolling stats per criterion across runs
- Notable lessons learned
- Recurring failure modes
- Edited by the meta-skill (Phase 6.5) during retros

**Tier 2 — raw per-run files (gitignored by default):** `./evaluations/runs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`
- The brief
- The scorecard
- User's free-text feedback
- Path to the archived `hero.gif` / HTML if user opts to keep them

User can opt in to commit specific runs (typically OSS repos they're happy to publicize).

### 6.5 Meta-skill: `repo-visuals-retro`

A separate skill (not part of `repo-visuals`'s runtime) for improving the skill itself. See `../repo-visuals-retro/SKILL.md` for its own design. Invoked on-demand when you have enough samples to spot patterns — not automatically per run.
